**Building a Platform from the Ground Up: Key Lessons from My Greenfield Journey – Part 1**
Taking on a greenfield project is an exciting challenge. Building a platform from scratch opens a world of possibilities, but it also comes with its fair share of hurdles. Having been through the ups and downs of this process, I want to share a few lessons I’ve learned along the way that might help others navigating similar paths.

This is Part 1 of my series on greenfield development, and I’ll be sharing more insights in future articles. Stay tuned!

**Do’s: Key Actions for Success**
1. **Establish a Team Charter**
Even for teams with prior experience working together, creating a team charter is invaluable. Familiarity can sometimes lead to assumptions, and a well-defined charter ensures everyone is on the same page. It outlines roles, goals, and communication norms, reducing misunderstandings and establishing clear strategies for handling conflicts.

For example, it’s helpful to agree upfront on who will make the call on one-way door decisions (those that can’t easily be undone) versus two-way door decisions (which are reversible). This distinction ensures everyone knows how to keep things moving smoothly, without unnecessary friction.

2. **Practice Active Listening and Inclusive Collaboration**
In my experience, creating a space where everyone feels heard can unlock unexpected and powerful ideas. The best ideas can come from any corner of the room, and the success of the platform depends on diverse inputs. Encourage open dialogue and brainstorming sessions early on to ensure better alignment. This approach sets a culture of teamwork that pays dividends in the long run.

3. **Agree to Disagree, Decide, and Move Forward**
Decision-making in greenfield projects can feel overwhelming due to numerous unknowns. Remember, perfect design doesn’t exist. At some point, you need to make the best decision based on the available information, agree as a team, and move forward.

Don’t get caught in endless debates or try to reach consensus on every tiny detail. Adaptability is key. Commit to decisions and keep pushing forward. The goal is progress, not perfection.

4. **Document the “Why” Behind Major Decisions**
For every major decision, document the reasoning behind it based on the criteria considered at the time. This doesn’t need to be lengthy—just clear and concise. When it’s time to revisit decisions, you’ll have a record of the original context, which will make it easier to assess if those choices still hold in the current landscape.

5. **Pair Engineers for Key Areas of Ownership**
Assign two engineers to co-own each critical area of the project. This ensures that there’s built-in redundancy and promotes knowledge sharing. When one engineer might be unavailable or when blind spots arise, having a second person ensures continuity. Paired ownership fosters collaboration, making the whole team more resilient and keeping progress steady.

**Don’ts: Key Actions to avoid**
1. **Avoid Over-Engineering; Let the Platform Mature Naturally**
There’s a temptation to design for every possible future scenario, but this can lead to overly complex systems that slow down development. Instead, focus on addressing immediate needs. Allow the platform the flexibility to evolve over time as real-world insights emerge.

Resist the urge to over-engineer. Keep future iterations simple and adaptable, rather than complicating them with assumptions that may never come to fruition.

2. **Don't overstep your role; stay within your lane**

Collaboration thrives when boundaries are respected. Overstepping roles can lead to confusion and disrupt workflows. While open communication is essential, it’s important to give team members the space to think independently and contribute ideas from their areas of expertise—free from the influence of others’ opinions.

By trusting in your team’s specialization and unique perspectives, you create an environment where collaboration flows smoothly, and efficiency improves across the board.

3. **Avoid excessive documentation in the early stages**

In the early stages of a greenfield project, requirements are often fluid, and documentation can quickly become outdated. While documentation is valuable, overdoing it early on can drain time and resources when things are still taking shape.

Instead, focus on evolving documentation alongside the platform. Once features stabilize, prioritize documenting for clarity and future reference.

4. **Don’t stop Advocating for What You Believe Is Right**

Advocacy is crucial but must be fact-based and grounded in data. Avoid arguing for the sake of winning—ensure discussions are constructive and focus on what’s best for the platform. 

Staying persistent, when paired with logical reasoning, can often lead to the best outcomes for the project.

5. **Avoid Bias from Existing Platform Design; Challenge the Status Quo**

One of the biggest advantages of a greenfield project is the freedom to innovate without the constraints of past designs. Avoid the temptation to default to solutions that worked (or didn’t work) in older systems. Encourage fresh, unconventional ideas. 

Challenge the status quo, and allow the team to think creatively about every aspect of the new platform.

**In Conclusion: A Thrilling Journey Ahead**

Embarking on a greenfield project is both a thrilling and demanding journey. The foundation you build now will shape the platform’s future. The lessons shared here provide a strong starting point for creating a successful team and platform.

By focusing on clear communication, inclusive collaboration, and adaptability, you can establish a resilient team capable of overcoming obstacles and driving the platform’s success. Greenfield projects can lead to innovative, sustainable solutions with the right balance of structure and flexibility.
